## Overview

* Concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP): The type system, variables, functions and methods, inheritance, classes and protocols.

* Control Structures: Using If/Â­Else clauses, Switch statements and logic to control the flow of execution.

* Data Structures: How to work with collections, such as arrays and dictionaries.

* Software Design: How to organise and format code for readability and how to implement the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.

* Networking: How to make asynchronous API calls, store and retrieve data from the cloud, and use the JSON format for server communication.

* Machine Learning: How to make artificially intelligent apps using iOS 11's new CoreML framework.

* Augmented Reality: How to create 3D objects in augmented reality and create incredible animations and real-life interactions using Apple's latest ARKit framework.

## Introducing iOS 11

The course includes over hours and hours of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge through making real world apps. e.g. Pokemon Go, Whatsapp, QuizUp and Yahoo Weather.

It's updated to include over 5 hours of content on Apple's brand new ARKit for making Augmented Reality apps and CoreML for making intelligent apps with Machine Learning. You'll be building image recognition apps and incredible 3D animated AR apps.

By the end of this course, you will be fluently programming in Swift 4 and be ready to make your own apps as an iOS developer.

You'll also have a portfolio of over 20 apps.
